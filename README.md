# Basic-Portfolio

Hi!  

The Basic-Portfolio is the first website I've made from scratch!  This was a true eye-opener of a homework assignment.  The challenge here was getting used to float and positioning!

Each of the links in the top right-hand corner will take you to a different tab for that page.  The games on Portfolio aren't linked to any actual assignments.  The Connect with Me page will link you directly to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackExchange pages.
