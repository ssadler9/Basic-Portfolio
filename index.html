           My name is Sam Sadler.  I am from Henderson, TX.  There wasn't a lot to do in Henderson growing up, so I resorted to playing sports and video games!  Golf has always been my passion.  I have been playing for as long as I can remember, and ended up playing golf for HHS!  Following my passion, I went to Mississippi State University to become a Class A PGA Professional.
       </p>
       <p>
           I eventually reached my goal at Mississippi State and graduated with a Bachelor's in Business and Marketing with a focus in Professional Golf Management.  I took my degree and started giving lessons as a Class A professional at Wooodforest Golf Club in Conroe, TX.
       </p>
       <p>
           After a year of golf, I decided it was time to prepare for my family.  I left the industry, and started working in Sales at indeed.com.  What an eye-opener that experience has been!  I have been able to work with employers to list their open positions online for job seekers to find easily.
       </p>
       <p>
           Working for a Tech Company lead me down the path I'm on now - becoming a Full Stack Developer.  I want to help people get jobs, and the only way I can do that better than I am now is to develop a better code for employers and job seekers to use!
