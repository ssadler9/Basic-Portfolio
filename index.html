       <p>
           My name is Sam Sadler.  I am from Henderson, TX.  There wasn't a lot to do in Henderson growing up, so I resorted to playing sports and video games!  Golf has always been my passion.  I have been playing for as long as I can remember.
       </p>

          I like going out on hikes and bike rides.  I'll eventually get back to my favorite activities: golf, swimming, bowling, and playing with the dogs.  I have to say though, the thing I miss the most about two useable shoulders is sleeping on my sides!
